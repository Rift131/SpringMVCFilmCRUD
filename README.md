## Overview
Welcome to our full stack development project that accesses a film database utilizing the MVC architecture pattern. A user is able to search for a film by its id or by using a keyword within the films title or description. Both of these search methods will display all of the details of the film(s) including their category and a list of the actors within that film. 

Once a film is returned, the user will have the option to either update the film or delete the film. The user is not able to delete films that are apart of our original database. However they are able to delete the films that they have created. If the user chooses to update a film but did not provide input for every field, the unchanged fields will remain unaltered.

## Lessons Learned
##### GitHub Version control
On two occasions our code developed into a broken state. Reading the code and following its sequence of events did not reveal a solution. As a team, we decided to use our prior "commits" to Github to determine what the code was in its prior versions. By reading through our "commit" messages, we were able to determine which version held the once working code we needed to get our program functioning again. We believe we were successful due to our practice of committing frequently as we reached minor milestones throughout the project.
##### Gradle
Working with the build automation tool Gradle gave us another tool in our troubleshooting tool box. We learned to recognize when the web page was not receiving the latest updates. These errors pointed us to utilizing a Gradle refresh in order to update the page to the latest version.
##### Collaborative working environment
Having constant lines of communication between all members was vital in ensuring we had minimal merge conflicts, and the fast application of 'swarming' a particular issue or problem that we had encountered.
##### Flow of control
Throughout this project we gained a greater understanding of the communication between the different parts of our web site. While troubleshooting we often found it helpful to talk out the model view controller architecture.
